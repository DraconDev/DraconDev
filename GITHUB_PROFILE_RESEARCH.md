## 2026 Refresh: New Profile Patterns (5 New Profiles Analyzed)

**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Method:** Playwright-loaded each profile, captured bio, pinned repos, README content, sponsor badge visibility. Screenshots saved to `/tmp/profile-*.png`.
**Purpose:** The original 131-profile analysis (2026-06-06) covered well-known top-of-feed profiles. This refresh looks at high-output Rust infra maintainers and OSS founders NOT in the original Top 10, to surface patterns the original analysis missed.

### Five new profile examples

#### A. @dtolnay (David Tolnay) — "the silent work"
- **Profile README:** 404 (no README at all)
- **Bio:** (empty)
- **Company:** `0xF9BA143B95FF6D82` (Ethereum address)
- **Location:** Redwood City, California
- **Sponsor badge:** visible (126+ sponsors per GitHub)
- **Pinned (6):** `cxx`, `anyhow`, `thiserror`, `proc-macro-workshop`, `syn`, `cargo-expand`
- **Pattern:** **Zero marketing. The work IS the profile.** The single most-used Rust crates in the ecosystem (serde, anyhow, thiserror, syn) have one author who never wrote a profile README. The pinned repos are the killer stat: 6 crates, average 4-5K stars, 6.7K+ on cxx.
- **Why it matters:** This is the strongest possible evidence that profile README content is *not* what makes a maintainer successful. The maintainer of the work that every other Rust project depends on has 9.4K followers and 126+ sponsors with no marketing copy at all.

#### B. @BurntSushi (Andrew Gallant) — "ultra-minimal"
- **Profile README:** 404 (no README)
- **Bio:** `I love to code.`
- **Company:** `@openai` (recently joined)
- **Location:** Marlborough, MA
- **Sponsor badge:** visible (106+ sponsors)
- **Pinned (6):** `rust-lang/regex` (4K★), `ripgrep` (64.9K★ — the 2nd most-starred Rust project on GitHub), `jiff`, `aho-corasick`, `bstr`, `memchr`
- **Pattern:** **Ultra-minimal bio + 6 monster repos.** 4-word bio. 6 pinned repos including ripgrep. No personal links, no blog, no socials beyond a blog URL. Joined OpenAI recently, but the bio still says "I love to code." Career-narrative lives in the commit history, not the profile.
- **Why it matters:** Most-starred Rust maintainer who is also at @openai. The pattern shows that the bio doesn't need to be a narrative; pinned repos are the narrative.

#### C. @fasterthanlime (Amos Wenger) — "content creator + dev"
- **Profile README:** 27 lines (verified via raw.githubusercontent.com)
- **Bio:** `hi, I'm amos! 🐿️ co-host of self-directed research podcast 🫐 teacher, video maker, software mercenary ✨ be kind, be curious`
- **Company:** `@bearcove` (his own co.)
- **Location:** Lyon, France
- **Sponsor badge:** visible
- **Pinned (6):** `facet-rs/facet`, `bearcove/rc-zip`, `bearcove/dodeca`, `bearcove/arborium`, ... (2 more bearcove/* projects)
- **README structure:** intro → "I run [bearcove]" → Current projects (3) → Experimental (4) → "I spend most of my time writing in-depth articles, making videos, co-hosting the podcast" → "Before I did this, I worked at companies including itch.io, netlify, and fly.io" → "In a previous life, I worked on cool stuff like..."
- **Pattern:** **Categorized projects (current vs. experimental) + multi-channel narrative arc in 27 lines.** Categorizes by stability (Current vs. Experimental), links all three output channels (articles, videos, podcast), tells the career story in 2 sentences.
- **Why it matters:** This is the closest analog to DraconDev's situation — content creator, multi-channel output, multiple Rust projects, has a personal company. The "Current / Experimental" split is a pattern DraconDev could borrow IF a "tangible things only" stance can accommodate it (probably no, since DraconDev's audited README shows only public/published work).

#### D. @yoshuawuyts (Yosh) — "8-line README"
- **Profile README:** 8 lines (verified via raw.githubusercontent.com/master/README.md)
- **Bio:** `WebAssembly and Rust @microsoft`
- **Sponsor badge:** visible
- **Pinned (6):** `futures-concurrency`, `async-rs/async-std`, `choojs/choo`, `rust-lang/effects-initiative`, `component-registry`
- **README structure (8 lines):**
  ```
  *Be kind to people, be ruthless to systems.*

  Concurrent Computing ←
  Programming Language Design ←
  WebAssembly and Rust at Microsoft ←

  u(๑╹ᆺ╹)
  ```
- **Pattern:** **Motto + 3 focus areas + ASCII face.** No project list, no stats, no links. The bio + 3 focus arrows + an ASCII face is the entire profile README. The pinned repos carry the project list.
- **Why it matters:** The minimum viable profile README. 8 lines. Most lines are non-text. This shows you can be a 3.3K-follower, 855-repo, Microsoft-employed Rust maintainer with a profile that would fit in a tweet.

#### E. @mitsuhiko (Armin Ronacher) — "founder, hybrid OSS+company"
- **Profile README:** 404 (no README)
- **Bio:** `Software developer and Open Source nut. Creator of the Flask framework. Founder of @earendil-works. Other things of interest: @pallets and @getsentry`
- **Company:** Earendil
- **Location:** Austria
- **Sponsor badge:** visible
- **Pinned (6):** `pallets/flask` (71.6K★, 16.9K forks — the most-starred Python web framework), `earendil-works/pi` (60.9K★, 7.3K forks — the agent toolkit for this very conversation), `minijinja`, `pallets/jinja`, `pallets/click`, `agent-stuff`
- **Pattern:** **Bio name-drops the killer work + founder role.** Doesn't list projects in bio — pinned repos do that. The bio says "Creator of the Flask framework. Founder of @earendil-works." which is the strongest possible 1-line positioning for a founder.
- **Why it matters:** Most relevant for DraconDev's `dracon.uk` founder positioning. Armin has the same dual identity — OSS-first, then a company on top. The bio is the killer stat, the pinned repos are the project list.

### Six new patterns the original Top 10 missed

| # | Pattern | Example | What it does |
|:-:|:--------|:--------|:-------------|
| 1 | **No README at all** | dtolnay, BurntSushi, mitsuhiko | The work speaks. 0 marketing copy. **3 of the 5 most impactful Rust/Python maintainers have no profile README.** |
| 2 | **Sponsor badge as the only CTA** | All 5 | A visible ♥ Sponsor button is the conversion mechanism — no text link needed. |
| 3 | **Pinned repos as the project list** | All 5 | GitHub's pinned-repos feature (max 6) is the de-facto project section. Profile READMEs that re-list projects are duplicating what pinned already does. |
| 4 | **Bio name-drops the killer work** | mitsuhiko "Creator of the Flask framework" | One line of bio that names your most-famous project. Higher signal than a generic "Software Developer" bio. |
| 5 | **Motto / focus areas instead of project list** | yoshuawuyts "Be kind to people, be ruthless to systems" + 3 arrows | 8 lines can carry the whole profile if the motto is right. |
| 6 | **Categorized projects (Current vs. Experimental)** | fasterthanlime | When projects vary in stability, grouping them by status is a useful pattern. (But probably **not for DraconDev** given the "tangible things only" stance.) |

### Concrete implications for DraconDev's profile README

| Current state in `README_DRAFT.md` | Pattern 1-6 implication | Action |
|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------|:-------|
| Hero line "Hey, I make tools that run themselves." | Stronger than a generic bio. Doesn't need to name a "Flask" or "serde." | **Keep as-is.** |
| Stats line "239K+ lines of Rust · 5,600+ tests · 4 on crates.io" | Stronger than a stat widget. Concrete. | **Keep as-is.** |
| 4 repos in "TUI & Terminal" category, one-line descriptions | Pinned repos could do the same job, freeing the README to be shorter. | **Consider:** could move project detail to Pinned and let the README be a hero + stats + 1-line tagline. But current structure also works. **No change recommended.** |
| "Links: dracon.uk · YouTube · Sponsor" footer | Matches the "sponsor badge + website + content" pattern. | **Keep as-is.** |
| No bio on the GitHub profile (DraconDev bio is currently empty/default) | Pattern 4 (mitsuhiko) shows a one-line bio name-dropping the killer work is high-signal. | **Consider:** add a GitHub profile bio line, separate from the README. e.g. "Dracon — Rust infrastructure tools, 239K+ LOC, 5,600+ tests." (This is a profile bio change, not a README change.) |
| No "Currently working on" or "Experimental" section | Pattern 6 would suggest adding it, but the audit's "tangible things only" stance rules it out. | **Don't add.** |

## Structural Analysis (131 Profiles)

### Element Frequency
| Element | Count | Percentage |
|:--------|------:|-----------:|
| Hero (heading/centered div) | 98 | 75% |
| Stats (commits/stars/PRs) | 89 | 68% |
| Projects (repos/tools) | 62 | 47% |
| Links (YouTube/Twitter/etc) | 88 | 67% |
| Personality (👋 emoji) | 52 | 40% |
| Products (apps/SaaS/extensions) | 58 | 44% |

### Line Count Distribution
| Lines | Count | What It Means |
|-------|------:|:--------------|
| 1-10 | 18 | Minimal — just links or badge |
| 11-20 | 25 | Compact — hero + brief intro |
| 21-30 | 32 | Standard — hero + stats + links |
| 31-40 | 25 | Detailed — hero + stats + projects + links |
| 41-50 | 16 | Extended — multiple sections |
| 51+ | 15 | Long — comprehensive profile |

**Sweet spot: 21-30 lines** (32 profiles, 24%) — enough to be informative, short enough to scan.

### What Makes Profiles Scannable
1. **One-line descriptions** — not paragraphs
2. **Bold project names** — eyes jump to them
3. **Categories** — group related projects
4. **Stats in one line** — "31727 commits, 22481 stars"
5. **No stat widgets** — they break and look generic
6. **Emoji section headers** — visual scanning

### Anti-Patterns Found
1. **Stat widgets** (github-readme-stats, waka-time) — 15 profiles use them, they break
2. **Contribution graphs** — 12 profiles, everyone has them
3. **Badge walls** — 20+ badges, meaningless
4. **Long paragraphs** — 8 profiles, nobody reads them
5. **No categories** — 25 profiles list projects without grouping
6. **Generic titles** — "Software Developer" with no personality
